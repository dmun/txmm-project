\section{Approach}
\subsection{Dataset}
To answer these research questions, data will be retrieved from ADHD-related subreddits on Reddit.

Items that would be useful are both comments and posts. Life-hacks would be more apparent in comments on a post titled ``What are your life-hacks?''. In other cases someone might already have a life-hack they just wanted to share, in which case the post itself would contain the life-hack while commenters can share their sentiment or expand on it.

These posts and comments are obtained by using keywords like \textit{advice}, \textit{hack}, \textit{tip}, etc.

\subsection{Methods}
\subsubsection{Evaluation/validation}
Topic modelling and semantic analysis will be used on the data to answer the research questions. For validation, the results can be compared to evidence based strategies similar to the previously mentioned study \cite{scalzo2024using}.
